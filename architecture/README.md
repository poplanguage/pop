# Pop Lang Architecture

This directory is the architectural source of truth for **Pop Lang**.

Pop Lang is a native, strongly and statically typed language inspired directly
by Luau. It keeps Luau's lightweight syntax, local type inference, first-class
functions, familiar control flow, table literals, coroutines, and focus on fast
tooling. It deliberately leaves behind Lua's use of tables as the hidden
implementation of classes, modules, records, and every other abstraction.

Pop Lang is not an object-oriented-first language. Programs are expected to use
records, tagged unions, plain functions, namespaces, generic algorithms, and
composition for most work. Native classes exist for the narrower cases that
need identity, encapsulated mutable state, inheritance, or runtime dispatch.

Pop Lang has no dynamically typed values. Inference may save the programmer
from writing a type, but the compiler must determine a concrete static type for
every value and operation. Native classes, modules, records, tuples, arrays,
and typed tables have explicit semantics.

The compiler is designed around backend-independent HIR and MIR. LLVM IR is one
backend representation, not the compiler's internal truth. This boundary lets
Pop Lang add a custom VM later without replacing the front end, type checker,
compile-time evaluator, or portable optimizer.

The examples define the canonical syntax direction. The full grammar will grow
with implementation, but `.pop`, the `pop` command, naming rules, namespace/
`using` headers, and Luau-shaped block style are accepted decisions. New syntax
must look like a natural extension of Luau, not JavaScript, Rust, or D
transplanted into a Luau-shaped file.

## Architectural invariants

- Every runtime value and operation has a statically proven type.
- There is no `dynamic`, `any`, dynamically typed escape hatch, or dynamic
  member/call operation.
- Type inference never weakens static checking.
- HIR and MIR never contain LLVM objects, LLVM opcodes, or LLVM data layouts.
- Source constructs are resolved and type-checked before reaching MIR.
- MIR has explicit control flow, calls, lifetime effects, and failure edges
  wherever those details affect code generation.
- Language semantics are identical across conforming backends.
- The experimental C11 backend consumes optimized verified MIR, preserves
  checked semantics without C undefined behavior, and rejects runtime features
  outside its declared capability set.
- Classes, modules, records, tuples, arrays, and tables are distinct
  concepts even when an implementation can share storage internally.
- Runtime services are reached through a versioned backend-neutral interface.
- Runtime implementation ownership is split among the pure PLRI contract, the
  portable collector, the native ABI vocabulary, and the native host facade;
  native symbols and platform state never enter PLRI.
- User-defined attributes contain typed compile-time values.
- Compile-time evaluation cannot parse or inject source strings.
- Reflection is compile-time-first, visibility-preserving, capability-limited,
  and absent from runtime artifacts unless explicitly requested.
- First-release retained metadata is limited to ADR 0096 codec schemas for
  non-generic records, enums, and tagged unions. Canonical typed
  `retained-adapters.popc` is the schema source of truth; generated
  `Codec.Schema<T>` Items are statically resolved and dead-strippable.
- Namespaces/types/attributes use `PascalCase`; values/functions use `camelCase`;
  only constants use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`.
- `using` changes compile-time name resolution and never loads code.
- Code ownership is `Item → Module → Bubble → Package → Workspace`; a Bubble is
  the independent crate-like compilation and `internal` boundary.
- Packages use `bubble.toml`; Workspaces share deterministic `bubble.lock`
  resolution and a `target/` cache without sharing visibility.
- Library Bubbles emit self-describing `.poplib` artifacts resolved by
  `BubbleIdentity` and the locked dependency graph.
- `bubble.lock` and `.poplib` control files use bounded canonical JSON; artifact
  integrity uses normalized SHA-256 file inventories under ADR 0055.
- Pop GC uses precise roots, a moving nursery, and concurrent mature marking.
- Proof-directed static reclamation keeps scalars and proven non-escaping
  arrays/aggregates out of Pop GC through verified backend-neutral lifetime and
  region plans; incomplete proof always falls back to precise tracing.
- Collecting safe points update typed `RootSlot` publications in place; object
  identity survives relocation while stale physical reference tokens do not.
- Source-visible built-in types and attributes use `PascalCase`, including
  `String`, `Int`, `Boolean`, `UInt32`, and `@Serializable`.
- `Pop.Internal` is the trusted private compiler/runtime library;
  `Pop.Standard` is the native Pop portable public foundation.
- Public-library APIs optimize for short direct call sites and explicit cost;
  convenience cannot hide allocation, copying, dispatch, authority, or native
  transitions.
- The `Pop` prelude is fixed, curated, and automatically available; ordinary
  standard-library use requires no `using` directives.
- Namespace declarations use explicit `public`, `internal`, or `private`
  visibility; Pop Lang has no `export` keyword/list.
- Public names use complete words. Arbitrary truncations such as `Iter` are
  forbidden; standardized initialisms remain word-cased (`Json`, `Http`, `Utf8`).
- Records/functions/composition are preferred over class hierarchies and fluent
  object APIs.
- Diagnostics have stable `POP####` identities and structured safe quick fixes.
- Human toolchain presentation uses complete embedded TOML catalogs for `en`,
  `zh-Hans`, `ja`, `pt-BR`, and `es`; one immutable locale context renders the
  same structured diagnostic and event facts for CLI and LSP consumers.
- Expected failures use the reserved typed `Result` union, nominal error
  declarations, exact prefix propagation, exhaustive recovery, and lexical
  last-in, first-out cleanup.
- Generalized iteration uses the reserved nominal `Iterable<T>`, `Iterator<T>`,
  and `Iteration<T>` contracts; arrays remain fixed and `List<T>` owns
  sequential growth.
- Generic calls infer one complete canonical argument list or fail statically;
  nominal bounds and verified portable specialization capsules preserve exact
  types and Bubble identity across dependency boundaries.
- Source overloads select one non-generic function by exact argument type pack;
  conversions, result context, declaration order, and runtime values never
  participate.
- Every normal Bubble receives the verified reserved `Pop.Standard` reference;
  package linking consumes the target implementation reloaded from `.poplib`.
- Lua-shaped `---` XML documentation comments are parsed, signature-checked,
  emitted with library metadata, and available to editors/doc tools.
- Non-empty XML documentation elements always use separate opening, body, and
  closing `---` lines; the formatter enforces the deterministic
  [ADR 0057](./decisions/0057-multiline-xml-documentation-format.md) form.
- Accepted architecture is a binding baseline. Undocumented semantic expansion
  or implementation divergence is a bug until an ADR changes the baseline.
- Reintroducing Lua's dynamic/table-centered architecture is a release-blocking
  **Lua regression**, not a compatibility feature.
- A future VM can consume MIR without reconstructing source-level meaning.
- Native FFI declarations remain ordinary statically typed functions; typed
  hashed link plans, exact ABI layouts/effects, scoped pins/handles/callbacks,
  and generated reviewable adapters replace raw flags, shell execution,
  runtime symbol lookup, or reflection.
- Foreign pointers expose unmanaged ABI storage or one compiler-verified
  lexical payload borrow, never a Pop object address. Immutable `Bytes` uses a
  read-only pin; general native storage uses explicitly closed
  `Ffi.Buffer<T>`; retained managed values use generation-checked handles.
- Canonical FFI layout descriptors use full SHA-256 fingerprints and compact
  nonzero `FfiAbiLayoutId` execution keys derived from their first eight
  big-endian bytes. Full artifact facts detect collisions and mismatches before
  a backend or runtime can use foreign storage.
- Scoped FFI borrow bodies are immediate synchronous closures represented by a
  verified `BorrowRegionId` call, never unrestricted function values. Native
  ABI 1.17 borrows only the immutable `Bytes` payload through a runtime-owned
  token; no backend calculates a managed-object payload offset.
- Typed FFI callbacks carry one compiler-proven function/context pair. Native
  ABI 1.18 roots the exact managed environment behind a runtime-owned opaque
  context and validates the callback site, generation, thread, serialized
  entry, and balanced transition without exposing a Pop object address.
- Native ABI 1.19 carries generated codec adapters through exactly
  `CodecWriteEvent` and `CodecReadEvent`, using a closed fixed-width tag/status
  vocabulary with no descriptor pointer, registry, runtime Item name, or
  variadic payload.
- The first stable checked nominal cast is an explicit interface-to-named-class
  target-type call returning `TTarget?`. It matches exact specialized class
  identity or a verified descendant, preserves object identity, and uses only
  private Bubble-scoped descriptor facts rather than reflection or names.
- `Text.View` and `Bytes.View` are non-allocating compiler-proven lender/range
  values. Exact structured callable summaries permit direct non-retaining calls
  and parameter-alias results; storage, capture, suspension, ownership, FFI,
  and missing-metadata escapes fail statically under ADR 0097.
- Deterministic FFI generation selects one exact target-owned manifest plan,
  verifies one hashed canonical declarative `.popc` ABI-and-policy descriptor,
  and publishes only validated reviewable source, closed shim output, and
  hashed metadata. The first embedded parser invokes no process and infers no
  safety fact.
- Retained-adapter descriptors never use JSON. ADR 0055 canonical JSON remains
  the separate control encoding for ordinary `.poplib` manifests and public
  reference metadata, which may reference but never duplicate the typed
  `.popc` projection.
- The initial compiler/runtime/tool implementation uses a Rust 2024 virtual
  Cargo workspace with architecture-tested crate dependency boundaries.

## Decision process

Changes that alter syntax alone belong in the language specification. Changes
that affect several compiler layers, observable semantics, compile-time
execution, metadata retention, object layout, the runtime ABI, or backend
portability require an Architecture Decision Record under
`architecture/decisions/`.

“The architecture is not final” means it can be changed deliberately. It does
not mean implementations may ignore it. An accepted ADR and dependent document/
test updates must precede a conflicting implementation. See
[Architecture conformance and regression policy](./19-architecture-conformance-and-regression-policy.md).
