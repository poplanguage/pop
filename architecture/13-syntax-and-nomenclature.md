# Syntax and Nomenclature

## Design character

Pop Lang source should be visually calm. The language inherits Lua/Luau's
strengths: few punctuation marks, readable blocks, little ceremony, and code
that resembles structured pseudocode without becoming vague.

The aesthetic test for new syntax is:

1. Can a Luau programmer read it without stopping?
2. Does it add less punctuation than the semantic value it provides?
3. Is the common case short while the uncommon case stays explicit?
4. Does formatting produce one obvious readable shape?
5. Is the construct distinguishable without editor coloring?

Pop Lang does not mix the visual dialects of JavaScript, Rust, D, C++, and C#.
It borrows C#'s namespace/artifact separation and metadata ideas, not braces,
semicolons, or modifier-heavy declarations.

## Canonical naming rules

There is no lowercase `snake_case` in Pop Lang source. Underscores are reserved
for uppercase constants and intentionally ignored values.

Public identifiers use complete words. Do not truncate `Iterable` to `Iter`,
`Configuration` to `Config`, or `Synchronization` to `Sync` merely to shorten a
name. Widely standardized initialisms/technical forms such as `Json`, `Http`,
`Io`, `Utf8`, `Ffi`, `Gc`, `Guid`, and the language term `Async` are allowed and
follow word casing. Namespace context removes repetition instead of chopping
words.

Public-library namespace roots, tier suffixes, experimental names, and explicit
`Unsafe`/`Native` boundaries are defined by ADR 0031 and
[Public standard-library architecture](./22-public-standard-library-architecture.md).
Those rules apply to library API design as well as source spelling; a familiar
framework-role name does not justify `Builder`, `Manager`, `Factory`, or
`Service` when an immutable configuration value and free function express the
contract.

ADR 0032 additionally requires concise call sites. Complete names do not mean
repeating context: write `Json.Error`, `File.open`, and `Http.send`, not
`JsonDecodeError`, `File.openFile`, or `Http.sendHttpRequest`. `Ui` and `Ai` are
accepted technical forms alongside the closed ADR 0031 and ADR 0033
public-library
vocabulary; arbitrary project abbreviations remain forbidden.

| Entity | Convention | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Namespace | `PascalCase` components | `Game.Players`, `Pop.Text` |
| Package/Bubble | `PascalCase` components | `Pop.Standard`, `Studio.Gameplay` |
| Class, record, interface, enum, type alias | `PascalCase` | `Player`, `Request`, `Serializable` |
| Built-in type | `PascalCase` | `String`, `Int`, `UInt32`, `Boolean` |
| User-defined attribute | `PascalCase` | `@Serializable`, `@Route` |
| Enum case | `PascalCase` | `Color.Blue`, `LoadState.Ready` |
| Type parameter | `PascalCase`, usually `T`-prefixed | `T`, `TKey`, `TValue` |
| Function and method | `camelCase` | `loadPlayer`, `calculateScore` |
| Field and property | `camelCase` | `displayName`, `currentScore` |
| Local and parameter | `camelCase` | `playerCount`, `requestId` |
| Module/source filename | `camelCase` | `playerService.pop`, `httpClient.pop` |
| Compile-time/runtime constant | `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` | `MAX_RETRIES`, `DEFAULT_PORT` |
| Ignored binding | `_` only | `_` |

`snake_case` such as `player_count`, `load_player`, or `serializable_attribute`
is rejected by the style checker. Public and private names follow the same
casing; privacy is semantic, not encoded with an underscore.

### Acronyms

Acronyms behave like words:

- `HttpRequest`, not `HTTPRequest`;
- `parseJson`, not `parseJSON`;
- `userId`, not `userID`;
- `XmlWriter`, not `XMLWriter`.

Established two-letter type-domain names may receive a narrow style exception
only through the language style specification, not project preference.

### Attributes

Attribute type names are always `PascalCase`, including compiler attributes:

```luau
@Serializable(version = 2)
@CompileTime
@Inline
```

Attribute names do not need an `Attribute` suffix. `@Serializable` is preferred
over `@SerializableAttribute`.

Built-in types are not lowercase keyword aliases. Write `String`, `Int`,
`Boolean`, `Float64`, `Byte`, and `Never`. The lowercase `nil` spelling is a
literal/keyword, not a type-naming exception.

## Lexical style

- Blocks end with `end`; braces do not delimit executable blocks.
- Semicolons are neither required nor recommended.
- One statement normally occupies one line.
- Commas separate list/data items and remain allowed after the last multiline
  item.
- Parentheses are used for calls and grouping, not around `if`/`while`
  conditions.
- `local` declares local bindings.
- `function` declares functions and methods.
- Type annotations follow names with `:` as in Luau.
- Method declarations/calls preserve colon ergonomics.
- Keywords are lowercase.
- Types are not distinguished with sigils or punctuation.

Decimal floating-point literals use familiar spellings such as `1.5`,
`6.02e23`, and `1_000.25`. An expected float annotation selects `Float32` or
`Float64`; otherwise the literal is `Float64`. Numeric casts use the concise
target-type call form `Float64(count)` or `Int32(total)`, not an `as` operator or
runtime conversion by type name. The complete numeric ordering operators are
`<`, `<=`, `>`, and `>=`. See ADR 0040.

Checked nominal casts preserve the same explicit target-type direction without
adding another operator. `FileReader(reader)` accepts one nominal interface
value and returns `FileReader?`; `Box<Int>(value)` names a complete generic class
target. This is a compiler-known checked conversion, not construction,
overloading, reflection, or runtime type lookup. The first slice does not add
`as`, `as?`, an unchecked assertion, or a type-value argument. See ADR 0095.

String concatenation uses the Luau operator `..`. Backtick interpolation keeps
Luau's `{expression}` shape, while `String(value)` is the explicit formatting
form for the closed primitive set:

```luau
local path = "src" .. "/main.pop"
local summary = `checked {count} files for {path}`
local exact = String(total)
```

Quoted strings use the portable escapes `\\`, `\"`, `\'`, `\n`, `\r`, `\t`,
`\0`, `\xHH`, and `\u{H...}`. Backticks additionally use `\`` and
`\{`/`\}` for literal interpolation punctuation. There is no JavaScript `${}`
form, universal `toString`, implicit formatting conversion, or runtime type
inspection. See ADR 0041.

Optional control keeps ordinary Luau blocks and adds only local expression
punctuation:

```luau
if local user = findUser(id) then
    local name = user.displayName ?? "anonymous"
    return name
end
```

`if local` and `while local` bind a present optional value in their body. `??`
is a right-associative lazy default operator that binds more tightly than `or`
and less tightly than `and`. Postfix `?` propagates `nil` only from a
single-optional-result function. It is not an unchecked unwrap or a general
user-defined operator. See ADR 0051.

Typed expected failure uses a word rather than reusing optional punctuation:

```luau
public error LoadError
    Io(error: Io.Error)
    InvalidData(message: String)
end

public function loadName(path: Path): Result<String, LoadError>
    local player = try loadPlayer(path)
    defer
        release(player)
    end
    return Result.Ok(player.name)
end
```

`Result<T, TError>` has exact `Ok` and `Error` cases. Prefix `try` propagates
only an identical `TError`; changing error families requires an exhaustive
match. `error ... end` declares a closed nominal error family with union-shaped
case payloads. `defer ... end` registers lexical last-in, first-out cleanup.
Postfix `?` remains optional-only. See ADR 0052.

## File shape

Checked documentation and typed attributes for the file-scoped namespace
precede the `namespace` header. Attributes after that header precede and attach
to the following Item, so namespace attachment never depends on whitespace or
lookahead across another declaration.

A source file has one file-scoped namespace, followed by `using` directives,
then declarations:

```luau
namespace Game.Players

private const INITIAL_SCORE = 0

@Serializable(version = 2)
public record Player
    name: String
    score: Int = INITIAL_SCORE
end

public function award(player: Player, points: Int): Player
    return player with {
        score = player.score + points,
    }
end
```

`namespace` and `using` are header declarations and do not need a matching
`end`. Records and functions use normal Luau block structure.

Namespace documentation and namespace-targeted attributes may precede the
header. ADR 0081 uses this existing UDA position for native link aliases while
keeping foreign declarations as ordinary bodyless functions:

```luau
@Ffi.Link("Pcre")
namespace Example.Pcre.Unsafe

@Ffi.Foreign("pcre2_config_8")
internal function configure(what: Int32, output: Ffi.Pointer<Byte>): Int32
end
```

There is no `lib` block, `extern` declaration dialect, or runtime library
object. The exact trusted attribute supplies the foreign meaning without making
ordinary empty function bodies foreign accidentally.

The `with` expression creates an updated record while preserving field names and
types. It is the preferred shape for simple data transformation; a class is not
needed merely to attach one operation to a value.

## Declaration style

### XML documentation comments

Structured API documentation uses `---` plus XML:

```luau
--- <summary>
--- Finds a player by identifier.
--- </summary>
---
--- <param name="id">
--- The player identifier.
--- </param>
---
--- <returns>
--- The player, or `nil` when absent.
--- </returns>
public function findPlayer(id: PlayerId): Player?
end
```

Documentation precedes attributes/declarations, uses PascalCase symbol/type
names inside checked references, and follows the canonical formatting/tag order
defined in [XML documentation comments](./20-xml-documentation-comments.md).
Every non-empty XML element uses separate opening, content, and closing `---`
lines; sibling top-level elements are separated by an empty `---` line. There
is no inline short-element form. See
[ADR 0057](./decisions/0057-multiline-xml-documentation-format.md).

### Visibility and namespace declarations

Pop Lang does not use `export` lists or an `export` declaration prefix.
Namespace-scope declarations state visibility directly:

```luau
public record Player
end

public function findPlayer(id: PlayerId): Player?
end

internal function loadPlayerCache(): Table<PlayerId, Player>
end

private function validateName(name: String): Result<(), NameError>
end

public const MAX_PLAYERS = 64
```

Every namespace-scope record, union, error, alias, class, interface, enum,
attribute, function, and constant resolves to one of:

- `public`: visible to dependent Bubbles and present in reference metadata;
- `internal`: visible to every Module in the same Bubble, absent from
  public reference metadata;
- `private`: visible only inside the current Module/file.

When a visibility modifier is omitted, the declaration is `internal`. The
sole exception is the exact binary-root entry declaration `function main(...)`,
which is assigned `private` by the target-aware entry contract from ADR 0026.
A library `main` is ordinary and defaults to `internal`; explicit `public` or
`internal` remains invalid for the binary entry. `local` remains for
block/function-local bindings and functions.

The declaration prefix grammar is deliberately small:

```text
namespaceDeclaration := [visibility] declaration
visibility           := "public" | "internal" | "private"
declaration          := functionDeclaration | recordDeclaration
                      | unionDeclaration | errorDeclaration
                      | enumDeclaration | aliasDeclaration
                      | classDeclaration | interfaceDeclaration
                      | attributeDeclaration | constDeclaration
```

An exact trusted FFI attribute may require its attached function declaration to
be bodyless, but it does not add another declaration grammar production.

Documentation and attributes precede that prefix. Visibility is stored on the
declared symbol; it is not a separate list maintained elsewhere.

A namespace itself has no visibility modifier. Its visible surface is the set of
public declarations it contains. `using` never changes or forwards visibility.

Functions live directly in namespaces; no static class, singleton object,
public-symbol table, or module return value is needed to contain them.

Record fields and union/error/enum cases follow their containing public type contract.
Interface members are public by definition. Rare class fields/methods explicitly
use `public`, `internal`, or `private`; `protected` is excluded from the initial
language to avoid inheritance-centered API design.

### Classes and methods

Classes remain available for meaningful identity or encapsulated mutable
lifecycle and retain the familiar Lua/Luau receiver shape:

```luau
public class Connection
    private closed: Boolean = false

    public function Connection:close()
        if not self.closed then
            self.closed = true
            -- Release the owned transport.
        end
    end
end
```

The class supplies native field layout and method resolution. The syntax does
not imply a table, metatable, or implicit string lookup. Records plus plain
functions remain the default for ordinary data.

### Interfaces

Interfaces contain public instance signatures without redundant member
visibility. A class names nominal implementations explicitly:

```luau
public interface Reader
    function read(count: Int): String
end

public class FileReader implements Reader
    public function FileReader:read(count: Int): String
        return ""
    end
end
```

`implements` is a static nominal contract. It does not enable duck typing,
runtime name lookup, interface fields, or default bodies in version one.

### Records and data

Data literals keep Lua's readable keyed form:

```luau
local request: CreatePlayerRequest = {
    displayName = "Ana",
    startingScore = 10,
}
```

The expected type decides whether a literal constructs a record, table, array,
or other supported aggregate. Ambiguous empty literals require an annotation.

### Functions

Return annotations remain visually light:

```luau
local function clampScore(score: Int, maximum: Int): Int
    return Math.min(score, maximum)
end
```

Omitting the annotation is the explicit empty result-pack form, not return-type
inference. A no-result function may use `return` without values or fall through;
a function that returns values must declare their result type. Parameters always
carry explicit types.

Generic declarations use Luau's angle form; explicit generic calls use Luau's
double-angle form to avoid ambiguity with comparisons:

```luau
private function first<T>(values: {T}): T?
    return values[1]
end

local name = first<<String>>(names)
```

Normal direct calls may infer the complete type-argument list when one unique
static solution follows from the expected result, arguments, and bounds. A type
parameter carries at most one nominal interface bound after a Luau-shaped colon:

```luau
private function consume<T, TSource: Iterable<T>>(source: TSource)
end

private class MappingIterator<T, U> implements Iterator<U>
end
```

Bounds may mention earlier parameters only. There are no partial explicit type
arguments, `where` clauses, structural bounds, or runtime generic lookup. See
ADR 0054.

Records and tagged unions use the same declaration direction. Generic record
literals receive their concrete type from expected context; generic union cases
use explicit call arguments:

```luau
private record Box<T>
    value: T
end

private union Choice<T>
    Value(value: T)
    Empty
end

local box: Box<Int> = { value = 7 }
local choice: Choice<Int> = Choice.Value<<Int>>(box.value)
```

Local functions and anonymous expressions retain Luau's `function ... end`
shape and may capture lexical values:

```luau
local offset = 3
local addOffset = function(value: Int): Int
    return value + offset
end
```

Captured state is statically typed and converted to a native environment, never
a table.

### Fixed type packs and multiple assignment

Parenthesized results and comma returns describe an exact fixed pack:

```luau
private function split(value: Int): (Int, Int)
    return value / 2, value % 2
end

local quotient: Int, remainder = split(value)
left, right = right, left
local result = split(value)
local first = result[1]
```

Each local may carry its own annotation. The right-hand side must be one fixed
pack of the target arity or an exact list of scalar expressions. Pop source does
not silently add `nil`, discard extra values, or use an untyped variadic carrier.
Multiple-assignment target locations evaluate left to right before all values;
stores then occur left to right. See ADR 0045.
Tuple projection uses the same one-based `value[index]` punctuation as
collections, but its index must be a statically in-range integer literal.

### Compound assignment

Compound mutation keeps Luau's compact operator spellings:

```luau
total += amount
message ..= suffix
values[index] *= scale
```

Only mutable locals/captures, declared class fields, and array elements are
targets. The target receiver/index and right-hand side each evaluate once, and
the corresponding ordinary typed operator defines the result, trap, allocation,
and effect semantics. Pop Lang initially accepts `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`,
and `..=`; it does not infer absent underlying operators from other Luau
spellings. See ADR 0044.

### Conditional expressions

Conditional values retain Luau's keyword form and lazy evaluation:

```luau
local description = if available then "ready" else "missing"
```

Both branches have one static type and the condition is exactly `Boolean`.
Statement chains spell the intermediate keyword `elseif` and use one final
`end`. Pop source does not use `?:`, truthiness, or `else if` as its canonical
chain form. See ADR 0043.

### Loops

The body-first loop stays close to Luau and avoids an extra `do`/`end` pair:

```luau
local value = 0

repeat
    value = value + 1
until value == 3
```

The `until` expression must be `Boolean`. Its `true` result exits; `false`
repeats after the body has executed. A local declared in the body remains
visible to that condition but not after the statement.

Numeric ranges use Luau's compact comma clause rather than a new punctuation
operator:

```luau
for index = 1, count do
    process(index)
end
```

An explicit third expression supplies the step. All range expressions have one
fixed integer type and the loop binding is immutable. `break` and `continue`
are standalone statements targeting the innermost loop; they do not take
labels. `continue` reaches the natural condition or advancement point of the
loop form. See ADR 0060 and ADR 0042.

Generalized iteration keeps the same Luau-shaped clause with one statically
typed source expression:

```luau
for value in values do
    process(value)
end

for key, value in entries do
    process(key, value)
end
```

The second form destructures one fixed tuple item. It is not Lua's dynamic
iterator-triple convention. Protocol calls resolve the nominal ADR 0053
identities and formatting never inserts an implicit close/disposal construct.

When the progression must be stored or passed as a value, the canonical form
is `Range.create(first, last, step?)`. It infers one exact fixed integer type
and implements `Iterable<TInteger>` without introducing a `..` range operator.
See ADR 0056.

### Tagged-union matching

The initial exhaustive statement uses ordinary block words rather than arrows:

```luau
match result
when Result.Ok(value) then
    use(value)
when Result.Error(message) then
    report(message)
end
```

Every case appears exactly once. `_` may ignore one case payload; wildcard arms,
guards, and expression-valued matches are reserved for later design.

### Compile-time values

Constants use uppercase names:

```luau
private const DEFAULT_TIMEOUT = 5
public const MAX_CONNECTIONS = 1024
```

Namespace constants default to `internal` when visibility is omitted. Ordinary
locals use `camelCase` even when the binding model prevents reassignment;
uppercase communicates a named compile-time/runtime constant, not merely
immutability.

## `using` style

`using` imports a namespace for name resolution; it does not execute code or
load a file at runtime:

```luau
using Studio.Shared
using Physics = Studio.Simulation.Physics
```

Wildcard punctuation is unnecessary. Ambiguous simple names are errors and are
resolved with a namespace qualifier or alias. `using static`, project-defined
implicit/global usings, and runtime-computed imports are excluded.

The fixed `Pop` prelude is a language/toolchain contract, not a configurable
global-using feature. It selectively exposes declarations marked by the trusted
standard library's `@Prelude` contract, so common code can write `Json.encode`,
`File.read`, and `Math.min` without imports while child members remain qualified.
Prelude names have lower resolution priority than locals/current namespace/
explicit aliases; `Pop.Json` remains available for intentional conflicts.

## Formatting rules

The canonical formatter owns whitespace. Initial rules:

- four spaces per indentation level, never tabs in emitted source;
- one blank line between top-level declaration groups;
- no blank line immediately inside a short block;
- multiline argument/data lists use one item per line and a trailing comma;
- lines target 100 columns, with syntax-aware exceptions for unbreakable names;
- binary operators have spaces; unary operators do not;
- no alignment with variable runs of spaces;
- attributes appear one per line when they have arguments or when multiple
  attributes are attached;
- namespace documentation may precede `namespace`; otherwise `namespace` is
  first, followed by a blank line and sorted `using` directives;
- comments explain intent and are not used to draw decorative boxes.

The formatter must be deterministic and idempotent. Style diagnostics should be
fixable automatically wherever the correction cannot change meaning.

## Reserved visual complexity

The following forms require exceptionally strong justification:

- nested generic punctuation deeper than normal type syntax;
- declaration blocks using braces;
- keyword modifier chains;
- sigils for ordinary types or values;
- postfix operators with invisible side effects;
- context-sensitive punctuation that changes meaning after type checking;
- macros that introduce syntax the formatter cannot understand.

The language should feel richer than Luau semantically, not noisier visually.
