## Stable identities

Compiler entities use explicit IDs rather than pointers as public identity:

- `WorkspaceId`, `PackageId`, `BubbleId`, `ModuleId`, `FileId`, and `SpanId`;
- `SymbolId`, `TypeId`, `ClassId`, `ErrorId`, `ErrorCaseId`, `AttributeId`, and
  `FunctionId`;
- `InterfaceId`, `InterfaceMethodId`, and `CaptureId`;
- `BlockId`, `ValueId`, `SafePointId`, `StackMapId`, `AllocationSiteId`,
  `LifetimeId`, and `RegionId` in MIR.

IDs can be dense within a compilation session. Serialized caches pair them with
stable definition/content keys rather than persisting raw session-local numbers.

## HIR

HIR is source-oriented and backend-independent. Every expression has a resolved
static type and source span. Every call identifies a typed dispatch category.

Representative concepts:

```text
HirBubble {
  id, bubbleId, namespaceId, usingBindings, bubbleDependencies,
  declarations, publicSymbols, attributes
}

HirDeclaration {
  symbolId, visibility: Public | Internal | Private,
  kind, type, attributes, origin
}

HirForeignFunction {
  symbolId, foreignId, abi, externalSymbol, linkAliases,
  parameters, results, effects, layoutFingerprints, attributes, origin
}

HirClass {
  id, typeParameters, base, interfaces, fields, methods, attributes
}

HirInterface {
  id, methods{interfaceMethodId, signature, effects}, attributes
}

HirExpr =
  Literal | Local | Assign | Block | If | Loop | Match
  | Function | Closure{functionId, captures} | Call{dispatch, effects}
  | Construct{classId}
  | FieldGet{fieldId} | FieldSet{fieldId}
  | Record | RecordUpdate | Tuple | Array | Table | TableGet | TableSet
  | ViewCreate{kind, lender, lifetime}
  | ViewSlice{kind, lender, start, length, lifetime}
  | ViewMaterialize{kind, view}
  | Convert{kind}
  | Return | Break | Continue | Await
```

This is conceptual notation, not a commitment to an implementation language.

HIR invariants:

- every name is resolved or represented by an explicit diagnostic-recovery node;
- every expression has a type, including internal `Error` and `Never` types;
- field and method accesses identify a member or typed dispatch slot;
- calls exactly match the resolved callable signature, receiver, results, and
  effect summary;
- closures identify every capture, its type, owner, and value/cell mode;
- interface calls identify the static interface and resolved member/slot;
- matches name every case of one resolved tagged union exactly once;
- implicit source conversions are explicit HIR conversion nodes;
- source spans survive desugaring through origin chains;
- no target word size is assumed for language-defined numeric types;
- no valid HIR node means “perform this operation dynamically.”
- every namespace-scope declaration has resolved visibility; `publicSymbols` is
  derived from declarations and is not a source-level export list;
- every item and source origin identifies its owning `ModuleId` and `BubbleId`.
- a `repeat` statement retains its typed body and `Boolean` exit condition until
  CFG lowering; its body-local scope includes that condition only;
- a numeric `for` retains its immutable binding, same-kind integer bounds,
  optional step, and body, while `break`/`continue` retain their resolved
  innermost-loop target until CFG lowering;
- a generalized `for` retains its exact item/tuple binding shape, reserved
  `Iterable`/`Iterator`/`Iteration` identities, resolved direct/interface
  dispatch, and body until CFG lowering;
- a conditional expression retains one `Boolean` condition and two same-typed
  lazy branches until MIR lowers them to CFG and a typed join argument;
- compound assignment retains its resolved mutable target, typed operator, and
  right-hand side until lowering can evaluate a receiver/index once and emit
  ordinary MIR load-operation-store instructions.
- a fixed result pack retains exact element types; grouped multiple assignment
  retains resolved targets until MIR emits target locations, values, typed
  projections, and stores in the order fixed by ADR 0045.
- table lookup and mutation retain exact key/value types; MIR makes optional
  lookup, insert-or-replace allocation effects, managed maps, and barriers
  explicit under ADR 0046.

## Compile-time HIR and values

Compile-time evaluation reuses typed expressions but has a smaller effect and
capability set. Values include ordinary immutable constants and compiler-owned
handles such as `TypeRef`, `SymbolRef`, `FieldRef`, and `AttributeValue`.

Compiler handles are opaque, session-local, and cannot be constructed from
strings or integers. The compile-time interpreter can:

- call functions accepted by the compile-time effect checker;
- allocate bounded immutable compile-time data;
- query UDAs on an accessible symbol;
- request a deliberately small set of facts through typed handles;
- produce constants and structured compile-time diagnostics.

It cannot parse source, construct tokens, inject declarations, inspect LLVM,
access runtime heap state, bypass visibility, or turn a member-name string into
a symbol. Compiler handles never lower to MIR and are never serialized as
runtime values.

## MIR

MIR is a typed control-flow graph organized by functions and basic blocks. Its
type system is smaller than the source type system. Nominal and generic facts
remain only where required for semantics, optimization, layout, or debugging.

Representative operation families:

```text
Control:       branch, condBranch, switch, return, trap, panic, resumeUnwind,
               unreachable
Values:        const, tupleMake, tupleGet, recordMake, fieldGet, fieldSet
Arithmetic:    checkedAdd, wrappingAdd, floatAdd, compare, convert
Memory:        allocateObject, allocateClosureEnvironment, allocateArray,
               load, store, captureLoad, captureStore, retainRoot, releaseRoot,
               lifetimeStart, lifetimeEnd, regionOpen, allocateInRegion,
               regionClose, viewCreate, viewSlice, viewLength, viewGetByte,
               viewMaterialize, viewEnd
Calls:         callStandard{standardFunctionId}, callDirect, callVirtual,
               callInterface, callIndirect
Types:         typeTest, checkedDowncast, makeUnion, projectUnion
Collections:   arrayCreate, arrayLength, arrayGetOptional, arrayGetChecked,
               arraySet, arrayFill, listCreate, listWithCapacity, listLength,
               listGetOptional, listGetChecked, listSet, listAdd,
               tableGet, tableSet
Optionals:     optionalIsPresent, optionalGet
Results:       resultMake, resultIsOk, resultGetOk, resultGetError
Errors:        errorMake, errorSwitch
Cleanup:       cleanup{CleanupScopeId, exitReason}, resumeCurrentUnwind
Runtime:       gcSafePoint{stackMap}, writeBarrier,
               pin{borrowRegion, payloadKind}, unpin{borrowRegion},
               ffiHandleOpen{managedType}, ffiHandleGet{managedType},
               ffiHandleClose{managedType},
               ffiBufferOpen{elementType, layoutId, resultCases},
               ffiBufferLength{layoutId}, ffiBufferRead{layoutId},
               ffiBufferWrite{layoutId},
               ffiBufferBorrow{layoutId, borrowRegion},
               ffiBufferEndBorrow{borrowRegion}, ffiBufferClose,
               ffiBytesBorrow{borrowRegion},
               ffiBytesBorrowLength{borrowRegion},
               ffiBytesEndBorrow{borrowRegion}, suspend, resume
Foreign:       enterForeign, callForeign{foreignId, abi, effects}, leaveForeign
Scoped:        callScopedBorrow{borrowRegion, nestedFunction, captures}
Debug:         debugValue, sourceScope
```

Under ADR 0095, the first `checkedDowncast` consumes one nominal interface
reference and carries exact Bubble-scoped source-interface and target-class
identities plus canonical generic arguments. Its result is exactly the optional
target class. It matches the exact specialized class or a transitive descendant,
preserves the operand's object identity, and has no allocation, mutation,
suspension, FFI, unsafe-memory, trap, panic, unwind, or safe-point effect. It
cannot be reconstructed from a reflective type test plus unchecked projection.
Collection operations carry concrete key, value, and collection types.

ADR 0085 gives each managed-capable allocation one `AllocationSiteId`.
Construction MIR uses ordinary managed-capable allocations and verifies before
optimization. Portable storage planning may then attach one closed
`StoragePlan`: `Elided`, `StaticSlot{LifetimeId}`,
`ScopedRegion{RegionId, LifetimeId}`, `Managed{AllocationClass}`, or the narrow
verified `Immortal` plan. `lifetimeStart`/`lifetimeEnd` and region operations
make every control-flow frontier explicit. The first proof kinds are
`NonEscapingAllocation` and `CommonLifetimeRegion`; the verifier reconstructs
them rather than trusting a backend or source annotation.

Callable HIR/MIR types and public reference metadata carry ADR 0097's structured
`CallableLifetimeSummary`. Each parameter is `DoesNotRetain`, conservative
`MayRetain`, `StoresInto(targetParameter)`, `Captures`, or `Publishes`; each
result is `Independent`, `ReturnsAlias(sourceParameter)`, or conservative
`MayAlias`. Missing metadata selects the conservative facts. That forces
ordinary owned allocations toward managed storage, but never admits a borrowed
view or creates a dynamic retention query.

`Text.View` and `Bytes.View` use compiler-known `ViewCreate`, `ViewSlice`, and
`ViewMaterialize` HIR with exact lender provenance. Canonical MIR carries the
typed lender, checked byte range, one borrow-kind `LifetimeId`, and explicit
`viewEnd`. A view descriptor has no allocation site or storage plan of its own,
contains no exposed raw interior pointer, and may appear only in the direct
local/parameter/result positions accepted by ADR 0097.

View create/length/byte-get operations have no ADR 0022 effects. View slicing
adds only possible `BoundsViolation`; materialization carries the ordinary
owned allocation and safe-point effects. Lifetime retention and result
provenance stay in `CallableLifetimeSummary` rather than becoming effects.

ADR 0081 foreign operations carry one resolved foreign identity, closed ABI,
exact parameter/result layouts, link aliases, and effect summary. They never
carry a runtime library/symbol string lookup. `enterForeign` publishes the
precise live-root map and starts the transition; every normal/unwind/cleanup
path balances it with `leaveForeign`. Under ADR 0082, a scoped `Bytes` pin or
`Ffi.Buffer<T>` borrow carries one typed lexical region, dominates only
permitted pointer uses, forbids suspension/escape, and is released on every
exit. Fixed-layout records carry a backend-neutral marshalling plan rather than
an object-layout reinterpretation. Physical calling conventions, symbols, and
object formats remain backend details selected from this contract.

ADR 0087 fixes each source borrow body as one immediate synchronous closure.
MIR names its nested function and captures in `callScopedBorrow`; the verifier
checks the nested body with the caller's region provenance and balances the
matching buffer or byte-payload end operation on every exit. `ffiBytesBorrow`
and `ffiBytesBorrowLength` expose only the optional immutable payload pointer
and exact length while the runtime token remains backend-private.

ADR 0092 represents a callback as one exact signature descriptor, named nested
callback body, typed capture environment, `FfiCallbackSiteId`, and either a
scoped region or an owned registration. Canonical MIR opens the registration,
projects its inseparable typed function/context pair, invokes the immediate
scope when applicable, and closes on every required exit. The verifier proves
signature/layout equality, one opaque context parameter, pair provenance,
non-suspension, serialized non-reentrant policy, region dominance, and owned
resource state. LLVM alone selects the physical thunk calling convention; MIR
contains no native function address or runtime symbol lookup. See
[ADR 0092](./decisions/0092-typed-ffi-callbacks-and-native-transition-abi.md).

ADR 0084 fixes the exact buffer operation shapes. Open constructs the exact
typed `Result` only after distinguishing allocation, success, and invariant
outcomes. Borrow publishes only the scoped optional pointer; its opaque native
generation remains backend-private state indexed by the canonical
`BorrowRegionId`, and the native returned length must equal the dominating
`ffiBufferLength` value. Every backend consumes the same validated target
layout catalog.

ADR 0086 derives each catalog key from the first eight big-endian bytes of the
full canonical SHA-256 layout fingerprint and rejects zero or unequal full
fingerprints sharing that compact key. HIR preserves the resolved trusted
`Ffi.C.Layout` identity; target-selected lowering constructs the catalog before
MIR verification. Neither HIR/MIR nor a backend substitutes a session-local
`TypeId`, declaration ordinal, host layout, or spelling-based attribute check.

Public `Ffi.Handle<T>` operations remain typed ordinary MIR values:
`ffiHandleOpen` maps exact managed `T` to `Ffi.Handle<T>`, `ffiHandleGet` maps
that exact handle back to `T`, and `ffiHandleClose` consumes the runtime
generation. They lower to PLRI retain-root, resolve-root, and release-root
operations with mandatory failure checks. They do not reuse the opaque,
lexically balanced `retainRoot`/`releaseRoot` temporary tokens used internally
by compiler-generated runtime transitions.

Optional comparison narrowing, pattern binding, lazy `??`, and postfix `?`
remain typed HIR concepts until canonical MIR lowers them to explicit branches
and typed joins. `optionalGet` names the exact optional value and inner type and
is verified only on paths dominated by the matching successful
`optionalIsPresent`; it is never an unchecked fallback. Optional propagation's
absent edge is an ordinary typed `return nil`. See ADR 0051.

`Result<T, TError>` construction, prefix `try`, error declarations, and
`defer ... end` remain typed HIR concepts. Canonical MIR lowers propagation to
`resultIsOk`, dominated `resultGetOk`/`resultGetError`, typed branches, and one
named failure edge. That edge traverses all active lexical cleanup blocks in
last-in, first-out order before constructing the exact `Result.Error` return.
Every cleanup entry and its internal CFG blocks retain the same typed
`CleanupScopeId` and one closed exit reason: `Normal`, `Return`,
`ResultFailure`, `Break`, `Continue`, `Unwind`, or `Cancellation`. A cleanup
chain may stay in the same scope or move to an earlier registered scope but
never reverses that order. The final panic-cleanup block uses
`resumeCurrentUnwind`; no backend reconstructs cleanup from source. See ADR
0052.

Generalized iteration remains a typed HIR construct until MIR lowers its
resolved protocol acquisition/step calls to ordinary statically identified
calls, `Iteration` discriminant tests, dominated item projection, branches,
and block arguments. Reserved `Pop.Standard` interface calls carry the exact
`BuiltinTypeId` and stable protocol method ID rather than collapsing that
identity into a user-declared `InterfaceId`. Every backedge retains the ordinary
safe-point contract. List growth is represented by distinct typed collection
operations; neither a backend nor the runtime resolves iterator members from
strings. See ADR 0053.

HIR generic calls retain their complete ordered semantic type arguments whether
they were explicit or inferred. Portable cross-Bubble specialization capsules
retain verified backend-neutral HIR plus opaque source Bubble identities; they
do not merge dependency declarations into consumer name resolution. MIR fully
specializes reachable concrete functions, data, classes, methods, and witness
mappings, deduplicates equivalent source-identity/argument pairs, and emits only
concrete call signatures and layouts. Type parameters and runtime type-argument
lookup do not reach canonical MIR. Verified typed sharing is an optional MIR
optimization and cannot change this full-specialization reference behavior. See
ADR 0050 and ADR 0054.

Numeric conversion operations carry exact source and target integer/float
kinds. Checked integer-target conversions name `NumericConversion`; float
ordering uses ordered comparisons so NaN does not make `<=`/`>=` true. These
operations never accept a runtime type name or defer conversion selection to a
backend. See ADR 0040.

Array construction always carries an explicit initial value. Checked reads and
writes carry `BoundsViolation`; optional reads do not trap for bounds. Scalar
and managed-element arrays remain distinguishable for optimization and precise
barriers. See ADR 0034.

MIR invariants:

- each block has one terminator;
- each value dominates its uses, or arrives as a block argument;
- each `optionalGet` is dominated by a successful presence test of the same
  optional value and exact inner type;
- each result payload extraction is dominated by the corresponding successful
  or error test of the same result value and exact type arguments;
- every edge leaving a registered cleanup scope traverses each required cleanup
  exactly once in last-in, first-out order;
- operand and result types are valid for the operation;
- control-flow edges pass declared block arguments;
- potentially failing operations have explicit trap/unwind/result semantics;
- calls declare effects relevant to optimization and safe points;
- call effects are a known subset of the caller's declared effects;
- every `MayUnwind` instruction explicitly propagates unwind or names a cleanup
  block; call instructions retain the same action as part of their exact call
  contract;
- stack maps contain exactly the live managed values at each safe point and
  logical object maps contain exactly the managed fields of allocations;
- every static lifetime/region start dominates its uses, every applicable exit
  crosses exactly one matching end/close, and no interior alias, borrow, root,
  cleanup observation, or managed/shared/foreign edge survives that frontier;
- every view creation dominates its uses, retains one exact lender, ends on
  every applicable exit within the lender lifetime, and never enters an
  aggregate, capture, suspension frame, ownership transfer, or FFI boundary;
- every view call argument/result agrees with the exact structured callable
  lifetime summary, while missing or conservative facts reject the view;
- managed view lenders remain precise mutable roots across safe points, and no
  cached interior address survives a relocating safe point;
- managed references held in static slots/regions remain in exact mutable root
  maps until end/close, while managed storage never points into static/region
  storage;
- cold task creation carries the exact logical object map for its captured
  dispatch environment, arguments, and retained completion slot; the map is
  derived from verified static types and never from current runtime values;
- a collecting safe point may change the physical token for every live managed
  value; backends/VMs install the typed `RootSlot` updates before subsequent
  uses without adding backend relocation instructions to canonical MIR;
- root scopes dominate their uses and are balanced on normal and unwind exits;
- every foreign call is dominated by its exact `enterForeign`, is followed on
  every exit by `leaveForeign`, carries the ADR 0081 mandatory effects/layouts,
  and cannot retain or suspend with an ADR 0082 pin/buffer borrow;
- evaluation order matches Pop Lang semantics;
- all target assumptions come from target queries;
- every call and member/collection operation has statically known types;
- no instruction performs name lookup or type discovery from a runtime string;
- MIR verification runs after construction and every transforming pass.

Body-first loops lower to ordinary CFG body, condition, exit, and backedge
blocks. They do not introduce a backend-specific instruction; the verifier
requires the same deterministic safe-point treatment as every other backedge.

String concatenation and primitive formatting remain typed in HIR. Canonical
MIR uses backend-neutral `StringConcat` and `StringFormat` operations, verifies
the exact operand kind, and records their allocation and safe-point effects.
Interpolation lowers in source order through those operations; it never becomes
a runtime format string, type inspection, or backend-specific instruction. See
ADR 0041.

Fixed type packs lower to one typed tuple-like MIR value. `tupleMake` constructs
an exact pack and `tupleGet` projects a statically indexed element; grouped
multiple assignment then uses ordinary stores and barriers. MIR contains no
dynamic variadic carrier, runtime arity adjustment, or comma semantics. See ADR
0045.

The initial portable failure/GC encoding is fixed by ADR 0022. Runtime traps
are closed `TrapKind` values and are not ordinary exceptions. Panic uses a
runtime-private typed payload. Expected failures continue to use typed result
values. ADR 0040 adds `NumericConversion` for checked numeric casts that receive
NaN, infinity, or an out-of-range value. ADR 0042 adds `InvalidRangeStep` for a
dynamic zero step in a numeric `for` range.

## Attribute representation

A resolved UDA is stored as its attribute type plus a canonical immutable value
and origin span. Attribute values may contain primitives, enums, type/symbol
handles, tuples, and immutable records/arrays accepted by the compile-time type
system. Runtime objects, closures with mutable state, raw pointers, and backend
handles are forbidden.

HIR owns compile-time attributes. MIR sees only semantic consequences already
resolved by the front end or explicit retained-metadata constants.

## Abstract layouts

HIR knows semantic fields but no byte offsets. MIR can request an abstract layout
for a type/class and refer to logical fields. The backend layout service chooses
offsets, alignments, stack locations, and calling conventions.

Primitive widths are language-defined where observable. Target-sized types, if
offered, are explicitly named. A generic integer name cannot quietly change
width between backends unless that behavior is specified by the language.

## Serialization and textual form

HIR and MIR have deterministic textual dump formats from the first milestone.
MIR may later gain a versioned binary form for caching and VM tooling. Dumps are
test formats, not automatically stable public APIs.

Every MIR fixture should parse back into the verifier. This enables backend tests
without invoking the Pop Lang parser or compile-time engine.

## Pass manager

Passes declare required/preserved analyses, control-flow effects, accepted MIR
stage, determinism, thread safety, and verification requirements. A backend
accepts only documented canonical MIR, never construction MIR.
