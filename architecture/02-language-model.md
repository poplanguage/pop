# Language Model

This document defines semantic direction and canonical syntax examples. The
complete grammar belongs to the language specification.

## Strong static type model

Pop Lang is strongly and statically typed. Every expression, local, field,
parameter, return value, collection element, and call target has a type known
before MIR is built. An omitted annotation requests inference, not dynamic
typing.

The initial type families include:

- the `nil` literal/type case, `Boolean`, fixed-width integer types,
  floating-point types, and `String`;
- tuples and function types;
- structural records;
- nominal classes and interfaces;
- generic types and constrained type parameters;
- unions, optional types, singleton types, and flow narrowing;
- typed arrays and tables;
- opaque nominal handles for resources whose representation is hidden;
- `Never` for expressions that do not return;
- an internal `error` type used only to recover after a diagnostic.

Namespace type aliases erase to their recursively resolved target before HIR;
they add no nominal identity or runtime operation. Alias cycles and type
arguments on the initial non-generic alias form are rejected. See ADR 0048.

Enums are closed nominal payload-free case sets. Cases such as `Color.Red`
carry their enum type and a stable case identity; their compact discriminants
do not implicitly convert to integers. Exact same-enum equality is supported.
See ADR 0049.

There is no user-visible `dynamic`, `any`, or unknown value on which operations
can be performed. A top type may exist for type-theory purposes only if values
must be narrowed to a concrete supported type before use.

### Optional flow

Optional values use absence-aware control rather than Lua truthiness. A stable
place narrows across `== nil` and `~= nil` branches. `if local value = optional`
and `while local value = optional` evaluate the optional once, test presence,
and bind the immutable non-`nil` value only inside the successful body.

`optional ?? fallback` lazily produces the inner type, evaluating `fallback`
only when the optional is `nil`. Postfix `optional?` produces the inner value
or returns `nil` from an enclosing function with a single optional result. The
operand and result inner types need not match. It does not propagate `Result`,
catch traps/panic, perform truthiness, or call a dynamic/user-defined operator.
See ADR 0051.

### Typed results and cleanup

`Result<T, TError>` is the reserved `Pop.Standard` tagged union with exact
`Ok(value: T)` and `Error(error: TError)` cases. Closed nominal `error`
declarations give recoverable error families stable identities and use the
same Luau-shaped payload and exhaustive-match surface as tagged unions without
becoming ordinary unions or an exception hierarchy.

Prefix `try expression` evaluates one `Result<T, TError>` and either produces
its `T` value or returns `Result.Error(error)` through every active cleanup
scope from a function returning `Result<U, TError>`. Error types must match
exactly; conversion requires an explicit exhaustive match. `defer ... end`
registers deterministic lexical cleanup which runs once in last-in, first-out
order on every scope exit other than a runtime trap. See ADR 0052.

### Static boundaries

- JSON and similar data are decoded into a declared schema, a tagged data tree,
  or a typed result.
- Foreign pointers use explicit typed wrappers and unsafe operations.
- Existential/interface values expose only the operations in their static
  interface.
- The first checked nominal cast uses an explicit named-class target-type call
  such as `FileReader(reader)`, accepts one nominal interface value, and returns
  `FileReader?`. It matches the exact class or a descendant by stable identity;
  it never performs structural/name lookup or produces a dynamically typed
  value. See ADR 0095.
- Heterogeneous collections use an explicit union or interface element type.

### Numeric source semantics

Decimal-point and base-ten-exponent literals are floating-point values. An
expected `Float32` or `Float64` type selects their format; without one they use
`Float` (`Float64`). They never implicitly become integers.

Numeric values convert explicitly through target-type call syntax such as
`Float64(count)` and `Int32(total)`. These forms are compiler-known typed
conversions, not ordinary overloads or runtime type-name lookup. Integer target
conversions and float-to-integer conversions are checked and use the closed
`NumericConversion` trap for invalid or out-of-range values. Ordering includes
`<`, `<=`, `>`, and `>=`; IEEE ordering comparisons with NaN are false. See
ADR 0040.

### String source semantics

`String` is immutable UTF-8 text. The Luau `..` operator concatenates two
strings, and backtick strings interpolate statically typed `String`, `Boolean`,
integer, or floating-point expressions. `String(value)` explicitly formats the
same closed primitive set; it is not an ordinary overload, universal inherited
method, runtime type-name lookup, or implicit conversion in another call.

Quoted and backtick literals decode a fixed portable escape set. Primitive
formatting is deterministic and locale-independent, while locale-sensitive or
user-defined formatting remains an explicit typed library concern. String
composition and non-identity formatting may allocate and are represented by
backend-neutral typed HIR/MIR operations. See ADR 0041.

## Luau-first syntax rule

Pop Lang starts from Luau grammar and vocabulary. Additions should reuse Luau
conventions:

- block constructs end with `end`;
- functions use `function`;
- locals use `local`;
- annotations use `name: Type` and `function(...): ReturnType`;
- methods retain colon-call ergonomics;
- braces remain data literals, not mandatory declaration blocks;
- semicolons are not required;
- namespace imports use semicolon-free `using`, not JavaScript destructuring.

Syntax that merely resembles another language should not be added when a
Luau-shaped form expresses the same semantics clearly.

## Default program structure

Most Pop Lang code should be expressed as data plus functions:

```luau
namespace Game.Players

public record Player
    name: String
    score: Int = 0
end

public function award(player: Player, points: Int): Player
    return player with {
        score = player.score + points,
    }
end
```

The `with` expression creates an updated record value and preserves static field
checking. Records are not tables and do not carry hidden method dictionaries.
Tagged unions and exhaustive matching model state alternatives without base
classes.

## Classes are native but exceptional

A class owns nominal identity, declared fields, methods, visibility,
construction rules, and layout. It is not a table with a metatable.

Canonical direction:

```luau
namespace Studio.Transport

public class Connection
    public endpoint: Endpoint
    private closed: Boolean = false

    public function Connection.new(endpoint: Endpoint): Connection
        return Connection {
            endpoint = endpoint,
        }
    end

    public function Connection:close()
        if not self.closed then
            self.closed = true
            -- Release the owned transport.
        end
    end
end
```

Construction keeps Luau's keyed-data beauty while producing a native class
instance with required-field and visibility checks. It is not a table literal.

A class is justified when at least one of these matters:

- stable object identity;
- encapsulated mutable invariants across operations;
- a lifecycle/resource owner;
- explicit virtual/interface dispatch;
- framework/runtime interoperation requiring a nominal reference object.

Data transfer, configuration, parser trees, messages, errors, options, and most
business data should normally be records/unions instead.

The semantic model supports:

- fixed-offset access for declared fields;
- direct dispatch for statically known methods;
- explicit virtual/interface dispatch where polymorphism requires it;
- separate static/class members;
- single implementation inheritance for explicitly `open` classes;
- multiple nominal interface implementation;
- composition without runtime table synthesis;
- no undeclared instance fields;
- no member lookup by runtime string.

Classes do not form an implicit root hierarchy. There is no `Object` type and no
automatic methods such as `toString`, equality, or hashing inherited by every
value.

## Typed tables and collections

A Pop Lang table is a statically typed associative collection. Both key and
value types are known. Heterogeneous values require an explicit union or common
interface.

Illustrative Luau-style syntax:

```luau
local scores: {[String]: Int} = {
    alice = 10,
    bruno = 12,
}

local names: {String} = { "Alice", "Bruno" }
names[1] = "Aline"
```

`{T}` denotes an array type and `{[K]: V}` denotes a typed associative table.
Specialized ordered/persistent collections can be ordinary generic library
values without changing literal semantics. Every read and write remains
statically typed.

`table[key]` requires the table's exact key type and returns an optional value;
a missing key returns `nil`. `table[key] = value` inserts or replaces one entry
and may grow the table while preserving identity and deterministic insertion
order. Assigning `nil` stores a typed optional value rather than deleting an
entry. See ADR 0046.

Tables do not define lexical namespaces, class identity, ordinary method
lookup, module initialization, records, or tuples. Pop Lang does not inherit the
full Lua metamethod system. Operator customization and iteration use explicit
typed protocols.

Indexed array assignment uses the same one-based indexing model as reads. The
assigned value must have the array's element type, and an out-of-bounds write
traps rather than growing the array or falling back to table semantics.

Compound assignment supports `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, and `%=` for the exact
numeric types accepted by the corresponding operation, plus `..=` for `String`.
Mutable locals/captures, declared class fields, and array elements are valid
targets. Receivers and indexes evaluate once; an indexed compound read is
checked and non-optional. See ADR 0044.

Arrays have fixed length. `Array.create<<T>>(length, initialValue)` constructs a
fully initialized array, `Array.length(array)` queries its length,
`Array.get(array, index)` performs a trapping non-optional read, and
`Array.fill(array, value)` replaces every element. Ordinary `array[index]`
reads remain optional. See ADR 0034.

`List<T>` is the distinct one-based growable sequential collection. Its
`create`, `withCapacity`, `add`, `length`, optional indexing, checked `get`, and
checked replacement operations preserve invariant element typing and stable
managed identity. Array assignment never acquires list growth semantics. See
ADR 0053.

`Range<TInteger>` is the distinct immutable inclusive integer progression.
`Range.create(first, last, step?)` infers one exact fixed integer type and
preserves the numeric `for` direction, zero-step, and checked-advancement
contract while implementing `Iterable<TInteger>`. It is not an array/list
materialization and does not add a range operator. See ADR 0056.

## Control flow and loops

Conditions are exactly `Boolean`. Statement `if` supports Luau-shaped `elseif`
chains with one final `end`. Conditional values use `if condition then value
else alternative` without a trailing `end`; exactly one branch executes and
both branches resolve to one static result type. See ADR 0043.

`while` remains the pre-condition loop. Pop Lang also has the Luau-shaped
body-first form:

```luau
repeat
    value = value + 1
until value == 3
```

The body executes once before each `Boolean` `until` condition. `true` exits
and `false` repeats. The body and condition share one lexical scope, so a body
local can contribute to the condition without escaping after the loop.

The first `for` form is an inclusive fixed-integer range:

```luau
for index = 1, limit, 2 do
    visit(index)
end
```

Bounds and the optional step are evaluated once from left to right and have one
identical integer type. The loop binding is immutable and body-local. Positive
steps use `<=`, negative steps use `>=`, zero raises `InvalidRangeStep`, and
progression is checked.
`break` exits the innermost loop; `continue` reaches the `while` condition, the
`repeat` condition, numeric-range advancement, or the next iterator step as
appropriate.

Generalized iteration uses one source expression and the exact nominal
`Iterable<T>`/`Iterator<T>` protocol:

```luau
for value in values do
    visit(value)
end
```

The source is evaluated once, `iterator()` is acquired once when required, and
each iteration performs one `next()` returning `Iteration.Item(value)` or
`Iteration.End`. Multiple bindings destructure one fixed tuple item exactly.
No member name is looked up dynamically and no iterator is closed implicitly;
resource-backed iteration uses explicit lexical `defer`. See ADR 0060, ADR
0042, and ADR 0053.

## Namespaces, using directives, Modules, and Bubbles

Every source file is a Module inside one file-scoped namespace. Packages declare
Bubble dependencies in `bubble.toml`; `using` makes available namespaces
convenient to name. None of these concepts is a runtime table.

Canonical direction:

```luau
namespace Game.Players

using Shared = Studio.Shared
```

Like C#, `using` affects name resolution only. It does not load a file or run
initialization. The locked Bubble graph and Bubble manifests select and load
implementation artifacts. Pop Lang keeps semicolon-free Luau aesthetics.

The one reserved exception is the fixed `Pop` prelude: normal projects can use
`Math`, `Text`, `Io`, `Json`, `List`, and other common standard names without a
`using`. External libraries remain explicit.

Module rules:

- every namespace-scope declaration resolves to `public`, `internal`, or
  `private` visibility; omission defaults to `internal` except that an omitted
  binary-root `main` is `private`;
- `public` declarations enter Bubble reference metadata;
- `internal` declarations are visible across Modules in the same Bubble;
- `private` declarations are visible only in their Module;
- `using` binds namespace visibility and aliases, never runtime values;
- dependencies form an explicit graph;
- cyclic runtime initialization is rejected;
- type-only dependencies do not require runtime initialization;
- visibility is enforced during resolution and compile-time reflection;
- compilation identity is separate from filesystem spelling.

The complete hierarchy is `Item → Module → Bubble → Package → Workspace`.

An omitted function result annotation denotes an empty result pack. It does not
request return-type inference: valued returns require explicit result types, and
parameters always require explicit types.

The complete artifact/load model is defined in
[Bubbles, namespaces, artifacts, and loading](./14-libraries-namespaces-and-loading.md).

## Records, tuples, and multiple results

Structural records have named typed fields and immutable field bindings. Typed
`with` expressions produce updated records; contained collection/reference types
retain their own mutability. Tuples have ordered typed fields. Neither silently
becomes a heap table.

Luau-style multiple returns use exact statically typed packs. A parenthesized
result annotation such as `(Int, String)` declares a fixed pack, and
`return count, name` constructs it. Multiple locals and assignments use comma
syntax with either one exact fixed-pack expression or an exact list of scalar
expressions; missing values are not padded with `nil` and extra values are not
discarded. MIR represents a fixed pack as one typed tuple-like value with
explicit construction and projection. Variadic tails must have known repeated
types or generic pack constraints and are not dynamically typed bags. See ADR
0045.

Tuple and fixed-pack elements use one-based static projection such as
`result[1]`. The index is a compile-time integer literal within the exact arity,
so the result type and MIR slot are known without runtime tuple lookup.

## Exhaustive tagged-union matching

The initial `match` is a statement whose arms use `when ... then` and must name
every resolved case exactly once:

```luau
match result
when Result.Ok(value) then
    use(value)
when Result.Error(message) then
    report(message)
end
```

The scrutinee is evaluated once. Payload bindings are statically typed and
arm-local; `_` ignores one payload. Version one has no wildcard arm, guard,
nested pattern, or expression-valued match. HIR retains `UnionCaseId`s and MIR
uses a discriminant switch plus typed payload projections, never tag-name
lookup. See ADR 0021.

## Functions, closures, and methods

A function value has a statically known function type and consists of callable
code plus an optional environment. Non-capturing functions can lower to plain
code references. Captured variables become explicit during closure conversion.

Local functions and anonymous `function ... end` expressions use lexical
capture. Read-only captures copy a typed value; a binding written by an
enclosing or nested function uses one shared typed capture cell. Environments
and cells are native managed objects with deterministic capture identity/order,
not tables. See ADR 0019.

A method is not a table lookup. HIR records the receiver and resolved method.
MIR turns the call into direct, virtual, interface, or statically typed indirect
dispatch. There is no dynamic dispatch category.

The first nominal interface surface contains public instance method signatures.
A class explicitly names interfaces after `implements` and must supply exact
accessible receiver methods. Class-to-interface conversion is a checked static
upcast; calls carry a resolved interface method/slot rather than a name. See
ADR 0020.

The inverse first-release operation is an explicit checked interface-to-class
cast. `FileReader(reader)` evaluates the interface value once and returns
`FileReader?`; a concrete `FileReader` or descendant succeeds without changing
object identity, and an unrelated implementation returns `nil`. The target
must be visible, fully resolved, and proven to implement the exact source
interface. See ADR 0095.

## Errors and effects

Recoverable failures use the reserved typed `Result<T, TError>` union. Prefix
`try` propagates an exact error type, while exhaustive `match` is the recovery
boundary. Closed `error` declarations define stable nominal error families.
`panic` represents violated invariants and unwinds for cleanup/diagnostics before
the task/application policy decides termination. IR distinguishes:

- normal returns;
- checked failure represented by typed results;
- runtime traps such as bounds violations or impossible-state assertions;
- panic unwinding and cleanup edges;
- cancellation and suspension;
- typed foreign-function failures.

All exits are explicit enough for LLVM and a VM to implement identically.

Function types, HIR/MIR functions, and calls carry closed effect summaries.
Checked operations name their `TrapKind`; panic calls record whether unwinding
propagates or enters a cleanup block, and cleanup resumes unwinding explicitly.
Expected failure remains a typed result value and is not folded into the panic
mechanism. Registered `defer ... end` blocks run in lexical last-in, first-out
order on normal, result-failure, loop-control, unwind, and cancellation exits;
canonical MIR owns those cleanup edges. See ADR 0022 and ADR 0052.

Namespace constants are deterministically evaluated once by the front end.
Runtime uses substitute the resulting exact typed immutable value into HIR;
they do not create mutable module storage or runtime name lookup. The initial
runtime-usable set contains primitive values and recursively fixed tuples. See
ADR 0047.

## Memory management

The initial runtime uses proof-directed hybrid memory management. Scalars and
scalar-replaced aggregates require no managed allocation. Arrays, records,
classes, and closure environments whose complete alias and lifetime frontier is
compiler-proven may use activation-owned storage or a compiler-inferred scoped
region. The same source type uses Pop GC when it escapes or runtime reachability
decides its death. Failing to prove a static plan is not a source error.

Pop GC remains the precise concurrent generational fallback, with a moving
nursery and mostly non-moving mature heap. User finalizers and weak references
are excluded from version one. Observable reachability, identity, resource
cleanup, and FFI pin/handle behavior remain language/runtime contracts, not
exposed heap-layout details.

MIR represents storage plans, lifetime/region frontiers, allocation, roots,
barriers, and safe points through abstract verified operations. It never embeds
a machine-stack address or collector-specific object header. No Rust-shaped
ownership/lifetime syntax, manual `free`, or implicit destructor is added.

See [Static memory management](./24-static-memory-management.md) and
[Garbage collector architecture](./15-garbage-collector-architecture.md).
